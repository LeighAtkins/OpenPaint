# Project Loading Functionality

## Current Issues
- [x] Basic loading of project files works (ZIP extraction)
- [x] Image thumbnails appear in the sidebar correctly
- [x] Switching between images doesn't display the correct image in the drawing area
- [x] Strokes are not always rendered after loading
- [ ] Position and scale settings aren't consistently applied

## Debugging Steps
1. [x] Confirm all images are properly loaded into memory (thumbnails show correctly)
2. [x] Fix image switching after load to ensure the correct image is displayed
3. [x] Ensure pasteImageFromUrl is called correctly for each image
4. [x] Verify that originalImages and originalImageDimensions are correctly populated
5. [x] Add debugging to redrawCanvasWithVisibility when switching images
6. [ ] Ensure vector strokes are loaded and drawn correctly

## Implementation Plan
1. [x] Fix the switchToImage function to properly display the selected image
   - Added redrawCanvasWithVisibility call in the code path where we restore state
   - Added proper logging to track image changes
2. [x] Add a verification step after loading to ensure all images are accessible
   - Added a forceLoadImages function that cycles through all images before displaying the selected one
   - This ensures all images are actually loaded and cached, not just their thumbnails
3. [ ] Improve error handling and logging for image loading failures
4. [ ] Add a visual loading indicator during project loading process

## Testing Scenarios
- [x] Load project with multiple images and verify all images display correctly
- [ ] Verify strokes are displayed on the correct images
- [ ] Test with various image sizes and counts
- [ ] Verify that switching between images maintains correct position and scale

## Notes
- Fixed issue where switchToImage wasn't causing the image to be displayed properly
- Added a sequential loading mechanism in project-manager.js to ensure all images are loaded
- Added redrawCanvasWithVisibility call after state restoration to ensure strokes are visible
- The fix forces each image to be loaded in sequence which ensures the browser caches them properly
