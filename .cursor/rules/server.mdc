# Server Operation Guidelines

- **Never Run the Server Automatically**
  - Always assume the user is already running the server on localhost:3000
  - If code changes require server restart, ask the user to restart their server
  - Only run the server when explicitly requested by the user
  - Before running the server, ask if the user wants you to run it

- **Port Usage**
  - Default port is 3000 (configured in app.js)
  - Only suggest changing ports if the user specifically requests it
  - If port conflicts occur, first ask the user if they're running the server already

- **Server Control**
  - Let the user control when to start and stop the server
  - Provide commands for them to copy/paste rather than executing directly
  - Example: "You can start the server with `npm start`"

- **Troubleshooting**
  - If server-related issues occur, first check if the server is already running
  - Ask "Are you currently running the server?" before suggesting solutions
  - Look for EADDRINUSE errors which indicate the port is already in use
